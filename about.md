<p>Hey, nice to meet you! My name is Shane Zhong and I am a Data Scientist 
focused on solving real business problems with the latest AI technologies. 
I am currently working in the Marketing Analytics team at
 <a href="https://www.theiconic.com.au/">THE ICONIC</a>, the Australian 
 largest online fashion retailer.</p>
 
 
My job is pretty straightforward: help marketing make more data 
driven decisions and optimise the efficiency of all marketing channels.
I love to work closely with the marketing team to understand the 
business problems and how I can improve their day-to-day works.

Outside of work, I also like to work on personal projects with the use of 
the state-of-art deep learning models such as BERT or GPT-2. 

If youâ€™re also having the same interests in data science, 
 please reach out, I would love to connect and exchange knowledge.
